My diploma work: Political Homophily during US 2016 presidential election

I didn't use github when I was working on the project, and I wasn't making an all in oine app that would need to be compiled and run. Thus, I ended up with a large number of scripts that I reused from time to time as certain procedures had to be redone, like scraping new subreddits. As well has certain scripts were made for my laptop which has python 3.8 whereas others were for the supercomputer on my campus which used multithreading and had python 2.7. So I have uploaded only the latter scripts. 

Here is the fruit of my labor: https://www.academia.edu/44161405/Examining_Political_Homophily_of_Trump_and_Clinton_Supporters_During_The_2016_US_Election?source=swp_share
