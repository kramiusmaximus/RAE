# Research in Applied Economics
My diploma work: [Examining Political Homophily of Trump and Clinton Supporters During
The 2016 US Election](report.pdf).


I didn't use github when I was working on the project, and I wasn't making an all in one app that would need to be run by python. Thus, I ended up with a large number of jupyter notebook scripts that I reused from time to time as certain procedures had to be redone, like scraping new subreddits. As well has certain scripts were made for my laptop which has python 3.8 whereas others were for the supercomputer on the university campus which used multithreading and had python 2.7. So I have uploaded only the latter scripts. This isn't so much an upload to show off my coding efforts as it is to make the most of the countless hours I put into this project:)
